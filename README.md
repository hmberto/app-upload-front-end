### You can also access the Back-end of the application by [clicking here](https://github.com/hmberto/app-upload-back-end).

### React App: An image upload interface. Node.JS v14.4.0.

## How it Works
First of all, using NodeJs v14.4.0 run **npm install** to install dependencies. Now navigate to the path **/src/services/api.js** and change the domain and port to your back-end environment.
~~~
const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://192.168.15.9:3000',
})
~~~

You can now start your application using **npm start**. After that it will be able to access your application in the browser through the address **http://localhost:3001** (if you have not changed).

## Resources
- Upload and store new images;
- Copy a link to share your uploaded image;
- Delete uploaded images;

## Important
By default the Back-end only accepts **image files** with a maximum size of **2MB**. If you want to change it you can take a look at the repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/hmberto/app-upload-back-end).

To change the type of file that can be accepted on the **front-end** you can navigate to **/src/components/upload** and change the **index.js** file.

~~~
<Dropzone accept="image/*" onDropAccepted={onUpload}>
~~~

All uploaded files will be stored in /tmp/uploads. Data such as name, size, id and URL are stored in an online non-relational database. We used mongoDB Atlas for this project. More details can be found in the [back-end repository](https://github.com/hmberto/app-upload-back-end).
